Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Food Recovery Network
==============================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   Maria, this is an excellent idea for a project!  Very impressive.  Having
   maps integrated will help with expansion and it will be good to have the
   statistics available.  Plus, it's such a worthy cause!

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
   I love the layout and design of the presentation ~ the color scheme is so
   great, and the graphics are really nice.  You have nailed the information
   needed for the proposal and have made me look forward to seeing and using
   it when it's finished.

   You did an excellent job with the presentation, too, spoke well, answered
   questions well, and were very self-assured.

Summary:
--------
Total:  5% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Nice job overall!  Great start to the semester.
